'''WikiaWare, Inc.: Mega Micropages!''', stylized as '''WikiaWare, Inc.: Mega Micropages!NERPASHIT''', and known as '''OKINEVILKILLSLAUGHTER''' in the [[Evil|PAL regions]], was a minigame compilation [[Video Game|video game]] developed by [[WikiCamp Industries]]. It was the second game in the [[Main Page|Wiki Camp]] franchise, following [[Wiki Camp Kart]]. The game was about rapid completion of "micropages", short minigames given to the player consecutively and with increasing speed per each game complete. 

However, WikiaWare, Inc.: Mega Micropages! was unfortunately cancelled, and the only thing that has survived are [[Image/GoToHell|images]] and a 2020 prototype ([[Sad|Very Unfinished]]).
