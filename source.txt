Alright, Team 17ers! It's time for an edit...

...war?

Huh!

This place seems to be as barren as my grasp on the Homestuck series!

...

I guess it could only mean one thing...

...

...

Some peace and quiet!

Gosh, this place has been ballistic for so long that I cannot even keep track of anything!

I guess while I am at it, I can probably muster up some ideas for...

...*yawn*! But then again... with this kind of atmosphere, I could probably use some shut-eye...

...warfare can come later...

...what could possibly go wrong?

==Cellphone's Super Epic Blog section==

Omg like hi guys! It’s Cellphone here XD So I don’t rlly know what a war is ^-^;; so I think I’m just gonna talk about myself lol! So like… one day I kinda just woke up in this weird storage unit and it was like sooooo confusin, I had no idea what was goin on you guys or how I got here, it’s like I was asleep for like 15 years, like how weird is that lmao! Just thinking about it makes me wanna rofl so hard! I basically decided to live here since it’s a fun place and there’s lots of cool stuff around here ^o^.

SO like, before this time I was owned by a girl called Emily, she was like the coolest girl evar!! `I’m pretty sure all of the stuff in this storage unit belongs to her, since she’s got her name on basically all of it lol! Though it’s so dusty she obviously hasn’t come here in a while….

..

I miss her… We used to go everywhere together, even if back then I didn’t have the ability to walk or talk or anything, I remember all the pics she took, the texts she wrote, the calls she’d make… Oh man she LOVED to prank call all the time… It was so Amazing how mad everyone got because of her XD

…Anyways, It’s not so bad being alone, though I really wonder how I was able to wake up when there’s nobody but me here… It’s super strange, right? 0_o Oh yeah! I can’t really see it, but there’s something hanging on the back of me! It doesn’t seem to do anything though… I occasionally think I hear noises coming from there, but maybe it’s just my imagination, being stuck here for so long is bound to make something strange happen lmao!

I think that’s enough talking about me! I’ve got an invitation to a picnic somewhere which is quite far away… Luckily I can get out of this place by crawling through the vent at the top… I hope nobody starts to get suspicious of me! Haha!  But before I go, check out this awesome meme I found!!!!

[[File:EPIC MEME.jpeg|thumb|center|This cat is so funny!!!]]

Alright Gotta go! Luckily I can remember how to get to the picnic...

'''Many Hours of travelling later...'''

[[File:Picnic teleport wormhole.png|frameless|center]] Huh... This looks a little dangerous...

'''Cellphone enters the wormhole''' 

Woahhhhhhhh!!!!!!

==Perry Llelogram Time==
A message to you all:

This is [[Perry Llelogram]] speaking for the first time to everybody else competing. I rarely speak so take advantage of your ability to read when viewing this. The army is coming. My own wretched [[The_Mario_Party|team]] doesn't even have any knowledge of this and shall find out from this message alone. We are coming to take this competition and you will not be able to stop us. There are so many of us that even I have lost count, and I am infinitely wise. If you believe this is a paradox, I ask you to travel to where the [[Queen_Elizabeth_II|Queen]] has gone recently. Prepare for war, fools. 

also babies do come from storks that sex thing is a lie dont tell [[God]] I told you this bye

==[[User:Scar|I]] lied ^_^;;==
sorry for [[Lies|lying]] please [[4|for]]<nowiki/>give [[me]]

Hi. This is my first time talking to you all semi-directly. It took me a month to figure out how to use a [[turtle]] to display big paragraphs of text like this... then it took me another month to figure out how to do it remotely.

But I got it working! [[Lua]], am I right? You'd expect a [[robot]] like this to come with some kind of [[manual]]. I had to reverse-engineer the [[programs]] pre-installed on this thing. I found it in an abandoned [[castle]], by the way. Perfect condition.

More about me: You can call me [[Vandalism on The Wiki Camp 2|"Vandal"]]. I'm a [[tinkerer]] of sorts, but at heart I am more of a lone [[vagabond]] or an avant-garde [[artist]]. Or a digital [[toymaker]].

I've been trying to manufacture [[toys]] for you fellow [[:Category:Competitors (official)|competitors]] as a gift of sorts, but I'm [[Damn seal|kinda stuck]] right now. The only toys I can really show you are via this [[computer]], and as I said, I spent two months trying to print text on a screen. I did come up with something I think is pretty fun, a few [[mazes]]. Even my teammates haven't seen this one yet, so this'll be good.
</div>

== Mazes ==
<div class="crt-blur">
You play as a little [[seal]] (it was the only thing I could come up with for some reason) You start at the left side of the screen, the entrance, and you must find your way to the hole to the right of the screen, the exit. Click on the seal and drag it through the maze. Best played with a [[mouse]], the turtle's touchscreen has lot of issues.

There are three difficulties of maze: Easy - 15x15, Medium - 20x20, and Hard - 30x30.

Okay, that was the pre-written part of this message finished. I hope you liked the mazes. What the fuck.

One, I have a suspicion that my [[Vandalism on The Wiki Camp 2/Inventory|inventory]] is full of sentient items. I'll unpack that one later.

Two, I'm no longer stuck. I think I'm gonna avoid you all in-person, nothing personal, just don't want people to see my face (not even you, teammates). Still on this team but like, you know, I'm not making more god[[damn seal]] games.

...Except for the [[Paper Niko|paper seal person]], you've already [[Paper_Niko#Challenge_2:_Teams|seen me]] so it's whatever. You can hang out but don't tell or show anyone else. Thanks.

P.S. For some reason I keep getting random new items in my [[Vandalism on The Wiki Camp 2/Inventory|inventory]]. It seems related to this camp. I'm not sure what's up with that.

P.P.S. I'm not sure if I'm gonna keep using this turtle or not.

P.P.P.S. I labeled this section "The calm before the storm" for a reason. Get ready for what happens next.

Hey guys, shockwave here to explain the joke. Much like [[China Bond Funds Restrict Inflows As Investors Pile In To Take Shelter]], the page Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars for the Xbox 360 is used once more because Damn Seal would be much too destructive to transclude, and even then, it wouldn't be that funny to many who have yet to edit the page. <br>
Shockwave out!

*For many [[centuries]] and [[eons]] an [[apple]] has been known to [[humans]],.This is known as a fact by many. But when it comes to the kinds, shapes, and varities of an apple, some humans find that thwy don't know it all? Below I have included an image and transcription of the apples humans know and love.

==FIRST APPLE==

===1920 x 1080 Apple===
this apple was first known to me only [[seconds]] ago. rival to the average [[red]] apple, it boasts capabilities unlike any mankind has ever seen before. With notable flavors and colors, the 1920 x 1080 apple is known for its appeal. It has earned the name "apple of apples?

==GREEN APPLE==

So b asically in my haste I had to invent a new kind of apple to finish the last. ummmmmmmmmm im kind of shy to show it to you so give me a second here, i only had 2 seconds to make it. its kind of ''soft'', kind of evil, and '''kind''' of DELICIOUS<blockquote>introducing</blockquote>

ok here it is. sorry
[[File:Ra.png|thumb|281x281px]]







do you like it?








ok im done here. thank you for enjoying the experience of the new apple with me, i am excited to unveil it to the rest of the world. i think we could probably get a 4m investment up front, 70% stake, what do you guys thin


[[File:Ra2.png|thumb|UPSIDE DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]]

===HEY===
WHO THE FUCK TURNED MY APPLE


[[File:Lol.png|thumb|my reaction when]]

== ok now im gonna [[infodump]] ==
i played [[psychonauts]] [[2]] recently and [[Mandelly|man]] that was a really fun game. storywise it had me on the edge of my seat and i'm not going to spoil anything but it's a really [[good]] [[game]]. my one [[problem]] is that it [[introduces]] a new jumping mechanic to make you (you are [[Razputin Aquato|razputin aquato]]) [[jump]] really [[high]], and it renders your other mechanics [[useless]] and STILL it's hard to reach shit sometimes!!!

also the psychic [[6|six]] might be a [[Loonatics Unleashed|loonatics unleashed]] group but im not putting them on the [[page]]. it wouldn't be [[right]]...

also i keep having dreams that are [[Elena of Avalor|elena of avalor]] and [[psychonauts]] crossovers. i think elena would be really good at [[Psi Blast|psi blast]] because [[blaze]] is her main [[spell]]. she'd probably also be pretty [[damn]] [[good]] at clairvoyance. there isn't [[teleportation]] in [[psychonauts]], which is [[cringe]], because that is one [[Fictional charcter|character']]<nowiki/>s main thing.


also semi-related did you know [[Sofia the First|sofia the first]] is turning [[10]] [[today]]?!! but only if today is [[november]] 18 [[2022]].

honestly i'm [[thinking]] about sofia she's such a character she is SUCH a typical baby show protagonist in the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|first season]], and we see how that affects [[others]]. meanwhile [[esteban]] from elena of avalor... he's the [[gru]]<nowiki/>mpy manchild character, and we see [[WHY this eepa in a ucket 😂|WHY]] he's [[that]] way. how others affect him. they're kind of some [[homestuck]] [[classpect]] i wish i knew more about that (don't tell me about that)


i don't have [[anything]] else to [[say]] but like. watch [[Sheep in the Big City|sheep in the big city]] [[Please|PLEASE]]!!!
