[[File:Editexample.png|thumb|An example of what an edit war may look like.]]
An [[Edit War]] is when two users or groups of users on a wiki disruptively overwrite each other's edits, usually due to having conflicting views on how the article should be presented. A [[LiSt|list]] of notable edit wars can be found on [[Wikipedia]]‚Äôs [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars Lamest edit wars].

==History==
The Edit War began during [[Challenge 3: Edit War|Challenge 3]]. On November 11, 2022, [[The Divine Goddess]] told the contestants to violently kill this poor article{{Citation needed}}. It is unknown why She wanted the page to suffer such a gruesome fate.

Hello, this is [[Diary]]. Throughout this competition I've been collecting a lot of these [[The Toy Where You Put The Shape In The Corresponding Hole|weird toys]], and figured I‚Äôve gathered enough to start my own [[yard sale]]. Look through these gizmos and follow the instructions of the [[Toy Blocks|toy(s)]] you want to play with. Or, don‚Äôt do that and play with the toys in ways the toymakers haven‚Äôt intended‚Ä¶? I dunno, I just want to get rid of all this [[Paper Niko|useless junk]]. Have fun.
