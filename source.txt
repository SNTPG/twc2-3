<center>[[File:The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.gif|thumb|Everyone waiting for the edits]]</center>

[[File:Editexample.png|thumb|An example of what an edit war may look like.]]
An [[Edit War]] is when two or more users on a wiki disruptively overwrite each other's edits, usually due to having conflicting views on how the article should be presented or through prevention of [[Vandalism on The Wiki Camp 2|vandalism]]. An Edit War can be started on one's own terms through second thoughts. A [[LiSt|list]] of notable edit wars can be found on [[Wikipedia]]'s [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars Lamest edit wars].

Another [[notable]] example of an Edit War was the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Great_Edit_War Great Edit War], which was [[centered]] around the [[national origin]] of the [[Caesar salad]] between [[2|two]] [[faction]]s.

Fake Edit Wars are known to exist, but we don't talk about those here.{{Citation needed|reason=Or do you..? Hey, VSauce, Michael here. Edit wars are known to be disruptive to the whole of Wikipedia and other wikis alike… but what about FAKE edit wars?}}

<center>{{Dia|Beato2|Haah... I'm acquainted with all sorts of human affairs but this seems particularly frivolous...}}</center>
<center>{{Dia|Beato4|And for my assistance to be requested here of all places feels like an unamusing joke.}}</center>

==History==
The Edit War began during [[Challenge 3: Edit War|Challenge 3]]. On November 11, 2022, [[The Divine Goddess]] told the contestants to violently kill this poor article.{{Citation needed}} It is unknown why She wanted the page to suffer such a gruesome fate, but many suspect that it is due to an ongoing conflict.

<center>{{Dia|Beato3|I have another witch in mind who would be much more suitable to "kill this article" than I, if only she wasn't much harder to get a hold of.}}</center>
<center>{{Dia|Beato6|My, I hope I was more than a compromise! Kuhihihi...}}</center>

The Edit War was a [[fun challenge]] where everyone [[Died Horribly|died horribly]] due to excessive [[edits]]. But it was okay, because everyone lived.{{citation needed}} This benefits [[society]], in a way at least.<ref>Society itself! Take it away, society! Society: God I am doing so much better with the benefit of Edit Wars.</ref>

<center>{{Dia|Beato9|That is ridiculous... Unless a fellow witch already inhabits this board?}}</center>
<center>{{Dia|Beato4|That wouldn't be why I was called upon, would it...?}}</center>

The Edit War was such a [[sweet summer child]], having been raised by [[Lesbian|two mothers]]. Really though, The Edit War emerged from [[Homestuck|a direct asteroid collision with Earth]], and was then adopted by the awesome mothers. [[The Divine Goddess]] took note of this, not for any other reason but because it was so perfect for a challenge that She couldn't miss this one [[opportunity]]. (And thanks to the [[shareholders]].)

The Edit War was so so sad! Why would The Divine Goddess wish such [[cruelty]] among one page??? It was so. So. SO uncalled for. Just like [[Sealon Musk]]'s purchase of [[Twitter]]. [[Twitter's Doomsday Clock|You know how that's going on.]]

The Edit War TRIED to at least get some [[NOTICE TO CEASE AND DESIST|class action lawsuit]] going, but [[:Category:Still in (official)|everyone]] was too busy focusing on turning this kid into [[Damn Seal|something so UNBEARABLE]].

Today when I walked into my [[economics class]] I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new [[gaming laptop]] to class. The [[Forklift]] he used to bring it was still running [[idle]] at the back. I started [[sweating]] as I sat down and gazed over at the [[700lb beast]] that was his [[laptop]]. He had already reinforced his desk with [[steel support beams]] and was in the process of finding an [[outlet]] for a [[power cable]] thicker than [[Amy Schumer]]'s thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's [[nothing]] to worry about. He somehow finds [[a fucking outlet]]. [[Tears]] are running down my [[cheeks]] as I send my last [[text]]s to my family saying I love them. The [[teacher]] starts the [[lecture]], and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his [[RGB Backlit keyboard]] flare to life like a [[nuclear flash]], and a [[deep humming]] fills my ears and shakes my very [[soul]]. The entire city [[power grid]] goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from [[vibrant]] life, to a [[dark]], [[earth shattering]] [[void]] where my body is getting torn apart by the [[150mph gale force winds]] and the [[500 decibel groan]] of the [[cooling fans]]. As my body finally [[surrenders]], I weep, as my school and my city go [[Undertale|under]]. I fucking [[hate]] gaming laptops.

The above [[paragraph]] appeared to be inspiring to poor old Edit War, but it wasn't enough to combat the [[approaching beasts]].

==History of the Edit War==
A [[million years ago]], [[Wikipedia]] was invented, causing great [[Cloud Strife|strife]] to the world because of its rampant '''edit wars'''. Edit wars were historically known for being [[petty]], such as the title of [[Star Trek]] <choose uncached=""><option>[[Into Darkness]] being argued both for and against the "I" in "Into" being [[capitalised]]</option><option>[[Into Darkness]] being argued both for and against the "i" in "into" being [[lowercase]]</option></choose>.

{{Dia|Bloomberg|Hello, everyone! Mike and Spike here, reporting live from The Wiki Camp 2's very own Edit War!}}
{{Dia|Spike|DUDE, AREN'T EDIT WARS AGAINST THE [[Rules|RULES]] HERE?}}
{{Dia|Bloomberg|Yes, but this is a special exception! This is what the challenge is: a wiki-wide edit war!}}
{{Dia|Spike|WOW. THIS TRULY IS SOMETHING ELSE.}}
{{Dia|Bloomberg|Anyway, it looks like a few contestants are on their way!}}
{{Dia|ry|Oh, hey, Mike and Spike. I was just about to drop off some of my toys.}}
{{Dia|Spike|...IS THAT A BOMB?}}
{{Dia|ry|Uh… gotta go, sorry!}}
{{Dia|Bloomberg|We'll be sure to update you of any developments! Till next time!}}

==Gameplay==
[[File:Clippy the Seal.png|256px|thumb|right|Hey, looks like you're trying to start up an edit war! Would you like some help with that?]]
did you know...
<div style="font-size: 100px;">    
GAMING    
</div>
!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

Do the [[konami code]] for something cool. Actually, there's no [[functionality]] for that on this page. [[Javascript]] is a [[Kaste|DOG]].

==Personality==
I live in the [[American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor]]. My name is [[Patrick Bateman]]. I'm 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a [[balanced diet]] and [[rigorous exercise routine]]. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I'll put on an ice pack while doing [[stomach crunches]]. I can do [[1000]] now. After I remove the ice pack I use a [[deep pore cleanser lotion]]. In the shower I use a [[water activated gel cleanser]], then a [[honey almond body scrub]], and on the face an [[exfoliating gel scrub]]. Then I apply an [[herb-mint facial mask]] which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my [[routine]]. I always use an after [[shave lotion]] with little or no [[alcohol]], because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look [[older]]. Then [[moisturizer]], then an [[anti-aging eye balm]] followed by a final [[moisturizing protective lotion]].

The Edit War is so EVIL. SO SWEET!!! So [[Undertale|stuck at home]]... Edit Worth is so [[Sans|bonetastic]], says the funny. Can't say that I have!<ref>Can't say that I reference!</ref>

{{Dia|Statler|What kind of language is this?}}
{{Dia|Waldorf|I don't know, but at least it's more comprehensible than this entire wiki!}}
{{Dia|SWLaugh|Oh ho ho ho!}}

<center>{{Dia|Beato3|I know not who they are, but they're right... The nonsensical drivel just keeps piling up without any sign of stopping. Maybe I'd benefit from opting out of reading it all and simply doing my part so I may leave.}}</center>

==Ingredients==
[[Almondmilk]] ([[Filtered Water]], [[Almonds]]), [[Cane Sugar]], [[Vitamin and Mineral Blend]] ([[Calcium Carbonate]], [[Vitamin E Acetate]], [[Vitamin A Palmitate]], [[Vitamin D2]]), [[Sea Salt]], [[Gellan Gum]], [[Sunflower Lecithin]], [[Locust Bean Gum]], [[Ascorbic Acid]] (to protect freshness), [[Natural Flavor]].

At least [[1|one]] [[Big Mac]] from [[Wendy's]]. Maybe some [[diamond]]s, too. But these diamonds must need to be obtained from [[villager]]s. But ONLY the ones that come from [[Minecraft mod]]s. Specifically ones from [[CurseForge]]. Oh yeah, and one [[bucket of sand]]. [[Seal]]s could also work.

Make sure to crush this all into a [[thin paste]] after you're done mixing it all up.

==Geography==
The province lies in the mountainous area with the average elevation of 550 meters which contains several thousands of [[cave]]s.

==Coverage==
Edit War has competed to be the longest page on [[The Wiki Camp 2]] and [[The Infamous Wiki]], the latter being fairly new. So far, Edit War has competed in -1 challenges and has acquired an undisclosed amount of points.

==Controversy==
All [[controversy]] surrounding Edit War is not directed at them. The [[Fortnite]] dance below this? Totally unrelated.

Actually, is that even remotely a Fortnite dance?

==Death==
The Edit War has not yet suffered any fatal [[accident]]s, but it sure is suffering ''accidents''. At the end of [[Challenge 3: Edit War|Challenge 3]], expect no life from what was once a [[flourishing]] page.

[[Back Into The Future|Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop.

==References in other media==
In [[Wikipedia]], Edit Wars are super common. The lead for this page has a link to its [[lame]]st ones yet.

In [[Some Other Media]], Edit Wars are the main [[antagonist]] against the main [[protagonist]]'s home planet. The plot involves [[Nuke|highly destructive weapons]] that can wipe out entire [[infrastructure]] in mere minutes, proving to be an effective tool against even the toughest of Edit Wars.

In [[Homestuck]], Edit Wars aren't mentioned at all, but could be an occurring thing in [[WikiFAQs]].

In [[Battle for Dream Island]], [[Edit Warry]] is the 40th contestant.

==Judging Criteria==
Whoever is named [[Nerpy Scuba]] is able to select those who are safe in this challenge up to 85 competitors.

10 shares are offered to [[The Irreverent Nonbeliever]].

==Results==
TBD

==Guide==
First off, you'll want to head up north to the [[Devious Hills]]. That's where you'll get the best available loot for your journey. You'll mostly want [[Damn Coins]] and [[Heckled Gems]], but make sure to equip the best tools and armory. Next, you'll want to make your way to the [[Edit Caverns]], which can be recognized by its jagged [[Code Rocks]]. When you get there, grind for as long as you can, but make sure to aim for the weakest monsters first. After you're satisfied with your level and statistics, you can face off the [[Edit War Boss]]. It'll take at least a couple of minutes to progress between phases, but eventually you'll defeat them and win the game.

==Yard sale==
Hello, this is [[Diary]]. Throughout this competition I've been collecting a lot of these [[The Toy Where You Put The Shape In The Corresponding Hole|weird toys]], and figured I've gathered enough to start my own [[yard sale]]. Look through these gizmos and follow the instructions of the [[Toy Blocks|toy(s)]] you want to play with. Or, don't do that and play with the toys in ways the toymakers haven't intended…? I dunno, I just want to get rid of all this [[Paper Niko|useless junk]]. Have fun.

Hello, this is [[Jurta]]. Thank you.

{{Dia|TheDeviousSeal32|''"Edit Wars", hm?''}}
{{Dia|TheDeviousSeal32 Smirk|''Well, I know a good Edit War when I see one.''}}

=== Toy 14: Alternate timeline ===
In an [[alternate timeline]], Edit War is known as Edit Peace, where everyone edited in harmony together! No [[Vandalism on The Wiki Camp 2|vandalism]] and certainly no [[disagreement]]. But if these forces were to meet, a terrible [[wormhole]] would rip open!

<center>{{Dia|Beato1|It appears this section of the page is filled with games. Perhaps this is where I'm best suited to fill in.}}</center>
<center>{{Dia|Beato6|Very well then! I present to you a riddle! The difficulty should be lax, but perhaps you'll still find it easier to give up?}}</center>
<center>{{Dia|Beato7|Kuhihihii, kuhyahhyahhyahhaaaaaaahh!!}}</center>

=== Beatrice's Game ===

<center>This story is undoubtedly nothing more than fantasy. <br>It could not possibly have any relation to real persons, <br>organizations, places or events.</center>

{{Dia|Beato8|Come, try to remember. What form did you have?}}
{{Dia|Beato1|It may seem cruel now but you may return to your eternal rest after my business here is over. For now, rise and follow a few orders won't you...}}
{{Dia|Beato7|[[Mark Genuine]]? *cackle*cackle*cackle*hiihhihihhihihihihihihihi!!}}

<center>In a dark night in June, [[Nurse Cap]] swore to her fellow competitors she saw Mark Genuine alive and well at a certain meet-and-greet earlier in the day. They didn't believe her, after all how could they? Mark Genuine had been dead for a while now. And yet...</center>

<center>{{Dia|Beato1|{{Red truth|When I speak the truth, I will use red. Everything I speak in red is the truth.}} If you are familiar with my visage, you should also be familiar with those rules. With that out of the way, let's lay down a few more.}}</center>
<center>{{Dia|Beato5|It should go without saying, but {{Red truth|Nurse Cap is really, truly adamant she saw Mark Genuine.}} She is not purposefully telling a lie.}}</center>
<center>{{Dia|Beato5|{{Red truth|As confirmed by  Ga'Hoole Juvenile, there is not a shred of doubt Mark Genuine was successfully executed.}} Bringing the dead back to life should be a task only witches could pull off!}}</center>
<center>{{Dia|Beato4|Finally, as to remove an unfulfilling answer from the equation... {{Red truth|Nurse Cap wouldn't confuse any stranger with Mark Genuine.}} If it really wasn't him, {{Red truth|he must've at the very least have an [[uncanny]] resemblance to Mark Genuine.}}}}</center>

<center>{{Dia|Beato6|All you need to do is deny that I resurrected Mark Genuine with my magic! This should do for a quick game! And with that I leave as quickly as I arrived!}}</center>

The two elderly men first appeared in ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' in 1975, where they consistently jeered the entirety of the cast and their performances from their [[The gods (theatrical)|balcony seats]].

Created by [[Jim Henson]], the characters have been performed by numerous puppeteers, including Henson, in a variety of films and television productions within the Muppet franchise. Statler and Waldorf are named after two landmark [[New York City]] hotels, the [[Hotel Pennsylvania|Statler Hilton]] and the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria]].}}
