[[File:Editexample.png|thumb|An example of what an edit war may look like.]]
An [[Edit War]] is when two users or groups of users on a wiki disruptively overwrite each other's edits, usually due to having conflicting views on how the article should be presented. A [[LiSt|list]] of notable edit wars can be found on [[Wikipedia]]‚Äôs [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars Lamest edit wars].

==History==
The Edit War began during [[Challenge 3: Edit War|Challenge 3]]. On November 11, 2022, [[The Divine Goddess]] told the contestants to violently kill this poor article{{Citation needed}}. It is unknown why She wanted the page to suffer such a gruesome fate.

==Early life==

==Gameplay==

==Personality==

==Ingredients==
Where's that damn recipe...

==Geography==

==Controversy==

==Death==

==Discography==

==Bowser's Castle==
[[File:Castlebefore.png]]

==References in other media==

==Judging Criteria==

==Results==
TBD

==Factions==
A number of loosely organized factions existed during the Edit War, with some only consisting of a few numbers and others being vast. 

===The CSS Faction===
[[File:Funny apparently.png|thumb|right]]The CSS Faction was a faction consiting of a variety of [[user]]s who spent hours upon hours coding CSS in order to spice up their pages. While the original intentions were good at first and were initially harmless, the [[people]] within the group began to see what could be gotten away with. pushing the limits of what they could do, they began crafting [[page]]s with intensive, disruptive, and borderline malicious code. These would then be filled up with intense amounts of CSS that would often slow a compuyer and it's browser, with tabs or entire browsers crashing not being uncommon.

The CSS Faction has become very divisive. Some people believe the CSS faction to be creative masters of trolling, while others believe them to be rather uncreative with their methods and would like to see them code malware if they want to dedicate their life to destruction. 

A number of users use CSS but do not associate with this faction.

===The unwilling participants===
The unwilling participants are [[a]] rather small group of [[contestants]] who simply participated for the sake of participating, and instead decided to only make a minor edit for the sake of surviving and to [[no]]t be subject to [[death]].

===The average users===
These users often [[contribute]]d to the page with decently sized edits and often had intense, text-heavy editing sessions in order to survive.

===Faction 4===
"eh uwje dsisie. fdjaiwr f ‚ô§‚ô°‚óá‚ôß" - Someone who wanted to fill up the page with bytes in hopes of earning a higher score.

==Aftermath 2==
The war has not yet ended as of the writing of this section, and this title implies that there is an aftermath to an aftermath, which is extremely confusing to the average reader.

==List of casualties==
A number of innocent people have perished during the war. These include:
*[[Mario]]
*[[Luigi]]
*[[Spike]]
*[[Mr. Incredible]]
*[[Mike Pence]]
*[[Waldorf]]
*[[Oh, so you like Techos? Name every Techo.|All Techos from Neopets]]
*[[Benjamin Harrison]]
*[[Homer Simpson]]
*[[Lightning McQueen]]
*[[Firey]]
*[[Garfield]]

==Damages==
The damage to The Wiki Camp 2 mainly consisted of clogging up the storage space of [[The Divine Goddess]]' own hard drive dedicates to hosting the Wiki.

==Teem Fair-E Land==
[[Teem Fair-E Land]] is a bad team and because they have no members they are expected to exist until the merge.

==BREAKFAST Party==
[[BREAKFAST Party]] is a team and because they have no members, they are also expected to last until the merge.

==Connections with World War II==
No.

==Yard sale==
Hello, this is [[Diary]]. Throughout this competition I've been collecting a lot of these [[The Toy Where You Put The Shape In The Corresponding Hole|weird toys]], and figured I‚Äôve gathered enough to start my own [[yard sale]]. Look through these gizmos and follow the instructions of the [[Toy Blocks|toy(s)]] you want to play with. Or, don‚Äôt do that and play with the toys in ways the toymakers haven‚Äôt intended‚Ä¶? I dunno, I just want to get rid of all this [[Paper Niko|useless junk]]. Have fun.

An [[Edit War]] is when two or more users on a wiki disruptively overwrite each other's edits, usually due to having conflicting views on how the article should be presented or through prevention of [[Vandalism on The Wiki Camp 2|vandalism]]. An Edit War can be started on one's own terms through second thoughts. A [[LiSt|list]] of notable edit wars can be found on [[Wikipedia]]'s [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars Lamest edit wars].

<span style="color:#ff0055;"> <nowiki>:</nowiki>O <( so like this doesn't count as an edit war right. cause each person only edits it once )

Another [[notable]] example of an Edit War was the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Great_Edit_War Great Edit War], which was [[centered]] around the [[national origin]] of the [[Caesar salad]] between [[2|two]] [[faction]]s.

Fake Edit Wars are known to exist, but we don't talk about those here.{{Citation needed|reason=Or do you..? Hey, VSauce, Michael here. Edit wars are known to be disruptive to the whole of Wikipedia and other wikis alike‚Ä¶ but what about FAKE edit wars?}}

'''[I'm gonna drop the colour thing here and replace it with bold text, it looks bad on the background.]'''

==History==
The Edit War began during [[Challenge 3: Edit War|Challenge 3]]. On November 11, 2022, [[The Divine Goddess]] told the contestants to violently kill this poor article.{{Citation needed}} It is unknown why She wanted the page to suffer such a gruesome fate, but many suspect that it is due to an ongoing conflict.

The Edit War was such a [[sweet summer child]], having been raised by [[Yuri|two mothers]]. Really though, The Edit War emerged from [[Homestuck|a direct asteroid collision with Earth]], and was then adopted by the awesome mothers. [[The Divine Goddess]] took note of this, not for any other reason but because it was so perfect for a challenge that She couldn't miss this one [[opportunity]]. (And thanks to the [[shareholders]].)

The Edit War was so so sad! Why would The Divine Goddess wish such [[cruelty]] among one page??? It was so. So. SO uncalled for. Just like [[Sealon Musk]]'s purchase of [[Twitter]]. [[Twitter's Doomsday Clock|You know how that's going on.]]

The Edit War TRIED to at least get some [[NOTICE TO CEASE AND DESIST|class action lawsuit]] going, but [[:Category:Still in (official)|everyone]] was too busy focusing on turning this kid into [[Damn Seal|something so UNBEARABLE]].

Today when I walked into my [[economics class]] I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new [[gaming laptop]] to class. The [[Forklift]] he used to bring it was still running [[idle]] at the back. I started [[sweating]] as I sat down and gazed over at the [[700lb beast]] that was his [[laptop]]. He had already reinforced his desk with [[steel support beams]] and was in the process of finding an [[outlet]] for a [[power cable]] thicker than [[Amy Schumer]]'s thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's [[nothing]] to worry about. He somehow finds [[a fucking outlet]]. [[Tears]] are running down my [[cheeks]] as I send my last [[text]]s to my family saying I love them. The [[teacher]] starts the [[lecture]], and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his [[RGB Backlit keyboard]] flare to life like a [[nuclear flash]], and a [[deep humming]] fills my ears and shakes my very [[soul]]. The entire city [[power grid]] goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from [[vibrant]] life, to a [[dark]], [[earth shattering]] [[void]] where my body is getting torn apart by the [[150mph gale force winds]] and the [[500 decibel groan]] of the [[cooling fans]]. As my body finally [[surrenders]], I weep, as my school and my city go [[Undertale|under]]. I fucking [[hate]] gaming laptops.

The above [[paragraph]] appeared to be inspiring to poor old Edit War, but it wasn't enough to combat the [[approaching beasts]].

GAMING

!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

Do the [[konami code]] for something cool. Actually, there's no [[functionality]] for that on this page. [[Javascript]] is a [[Kaste|DOG]].

==Personality==
I live in the [[American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor]]. My name is [[Patrick Bateman]]. I'm 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a [[balanced diet]] and [[rigorous exercise routine]]. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I'll put on an ice pack while doing [[stomach crunches]]. I can do [[1000]] now. After I remove the ice pack I use a [[deep pore cleanser lotion]]. In the shower I use a [[water activated gel cleanser]], then a [[honey almond body scrub]], and on the face an [[exfoliating gel scrub]]. Then I apply an [[herb-mint facial mask]] which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my [[routine]]. I always use an after [[shave lotion]] with little or no [[alcohol]], because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look [[older]]. Then [[moisturizer]], then an [[anti-aging eye balm]] followed by a final [[moisturizing protective lotion]].

The Edit War is so EVIL. SO SWEET!!! So [[Undertale|stuck at home]]... Edit Worth is so [[Sans|bonetastic]], says the funny. Can't say that I have!<ref>Can't say that I reference!</ref>

==Ingredients==
[[Almondmilk]] ([[Filtered Water]], [[Almonds]]), [[Cane Sugar]], [[Vitamin and Mineral Blend]] ([[Calcium Carbonate]], [[Vitamin E Acetate]], [[Vitamin A Palmitate]], [[Vitamin D2]]), [[Sea Salt]], [[Gellan Gum]], [[Sunflower Lecithin]], [[Locust Bean Gum]], [[Ascorbic Acid]] (to protect freshness), [[Natural Flavor]].

At least [[1|one]] [[Big Mac]] from [[Wendy's]]. Maybe some [[diamond]]s, too. But these diamonds must need to be obtained from [[villager]]s. But ONLY the ones that come from [[Minecraft mod]]s. Specifically ones from [[CurseForge]]. Oh yeah, and one [[bucket of sand]]. [[Seal]]s could also work.

Make sure to crush this all into a [[thin paste]] after you're done mixing it all up.

review: i ate aALL of this recipe after i made it PERFECTLY and i almost died. 2/5 stars (one star for killing seals)

==Controversy==
All [[controversy]] surrounding Edit War is not directed at them. The [[Fortnite]] dance below this? Totally unrelated.

Actually, is that even remotely a Fortnite dance?

==Death==
The Edit War has not yet suffered any fatal [[accident]]s, but it sure is suffering ''accidents''. At the end of [[Challenge 3: Edit War|Challenge 3]], expect no life from what was once a [[flourishing]] page.

'''( hey weird lady, is this paragraph talking about what you were going to do? or is it just misinformation )> ^^?'''

{{Dia|Beato6|Who's to say, in the end?}}

'''/:/ <( you? )'''

[[Back Into The Future|Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under. I fucking hate gaming laptops.]]

==References in other media==
In [[Wikipedia]], Edit Wars are super common. The lead for this page has a link to its [[lame]]st ones yet.

In [[Some Other Media]], Edit Wars are the main [[antagonist]] against the main [[protagonist]]'s home planet. The plot involves [[Nuke|highly destructive weapons]] that can wipe out entire [[infrastructure]] in mere minutes, proving to be an effective tool against even the toughest of Edit Wars.

In [[Homestuck]], Edit Wars aren't mentioned at all, but could be an occurring thing in [[WikiFAQs]].

In [[Battle for Dream Island]], [[Edit Warry]] is the 40th contestant.

'''<nowiki>:</nowiki>U <( edit wars are a lot more common than i thought. weird that i've never been a part of one! )'''

'''[But you have?]'''

'''( really?? when? )> :O'''

'''[Everything with you, me, and Playlist, on the fanclub team? That was an edit war.]'''

'''( my first edit war... )> ^^'''
{{Dia|Beato3|Hmm? Who is this? A fourth party involved in talking across the page?}}
{{Dia|Beato8|Kuhihi, how curious... you seem to exist as one of many forms! This case truly is shaping up to be something.}}
'''[uh]'''

'''Emoticon do you know this thing?? Is it the same as you? Do we need to worry?'''

'''( lol you forgot your brackets )> :Y'''

'''( anyway don't ask me, she was here when we came in )> :T'''
{{Dia|Beato1|Oh, I'm just a friendly witch. You don't need to worry about me!}}
{{Dia|Beato8|I'm here to "kill" this page, though I'm taking a short detour to investigate it as well.}}
{{Dia|Beato7|Really, you don't need to worry about me in any manner! It'd be pointless for me to do anything to someone such as you. No need to worry at all!}}
'''[...]'''


==Judging Criteria==
Whoever is named [[Nerpy Scuba]] is able to select those who are safe in this challenge up to 85 competitors.

10 shares are offered to [[The Irreverent Nonbeliever]].

'''BD <( emoticon and her team get first place!!!!!!! )'''

==Results==
TBD

==Guide==
First off, you'll want to head up north to the [[Devious Hills]]. That's where you'll get the best available loot for your journey. You'll mostly want [[Damn Coins]] and [[Heckled Gems]], but make sure to equip the best tools and armory. Next, you'll want to make your way to the [[Edit Caverns]], which can be recognized by its jagged [[Code Rocks]]. When you get there, grind for as long as you can, but make sure to aim for the weakest monsters first. After you're satisfied with your level and statistics, you can face off the [[Edit War Boss]]. It'll take at least a couple of minutes to progress between phases, but eventually you'll defeat them and win the game.

==Yard sale==
Hello, this is [[Diary]]. Throughout this competition I've been collecting a lot of these [[The Toy Where You Put The Shape In The Corresponding Hole|weird toys]], and figured I've gathered enough to start my own [[yard sale]]. Look through these gizmos and follow the instructions of the [[Toy Blocks|toy(s)]] you want to play with. Or, don't do that and play with the toys in ways the toymakers haven't intended‚Ä¶? I dunno, I just want to get rid of all this [[Paper Niko|useless junk]]. Have fun.

Hello, this is [[Jurta]]. Thank you.

{{Dia|Waldonf|'''Statler''' and '''Waldorf''' are a pair of [[The Muppets|Muppet]] characters best known for their cantankerous opinions and shared penchant for [[Heckler|heckling]]. The two elderly men first appeared in ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' in 1975, where they consistently jeered the entirety of the cast and their performances from their [[The gods (theatrical)|balcony seats]].

Created by [[Jim Henson]], the characters have been performed by numerous puppeteers, including Henson, in a variety of films and television productions within the Muppet franchise. Statler and Waldorf are named after two landmark [[New York City]] hotels, the [[Hotel Pennsylvania|Statler Hilton]] and the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria]].}}

{{Dia|CHUBSWORLD_|Thanks, guys. Anyway, I'm sure you're aware of The Wiki Camp 2's exciting competitive scene. But, what I really want to talk about is the singleplayer content.}}
{{Dia|CHUBSWORLD_|It's such an underrated gem and I really wish it were brought up more. Did you know they have a Classic Mode now, where every [[:Category:Competitors (official)|character]] has their own route and stuff? Whoa!}}
{{Dia|CHUBSWORLD_|TAke a look, y'all: [[Edit War#Classic Mode|IMG_4346.jpeg]]}}

==Classic Mode==
{{Distinguish|Edit War (Hard Mode)}}
'''Classic Mode''' is a single-player campaign mode in [[The Wiki Camp 2]]. This mode features six rounds of battles featuring pre-determined opponents, stages, and music, followed by a bonus game and a final round that ''usually'' involves a bossfight with [[The Divine Goddess]]. Notably, each character has a unique, titled route that is themed around them. 

Players can adjust the intensity of their routes at the start by use of an interactable mural, which scales from 2.0 to 9.9. From there, the intensity will increase or decrease depending on the player's performance in each round. The higher the intensity, the farther the player will progress into the mural. Although players only have one [[Stock]] to complete Classic Mode, should they [[Die]], they can revive themselves for [[2000 Coins]] (or for [[free]] if they have a [[Wiki Camp 2 Premium]] membership) and continue, albeit with a decreased score and intensity. 

After completing Classic Mode, the [[Credits]] will [[Roll]] and the [[Player]] will be able to play a [[Touhous]] throughout the credits, accompanied by [[Music]]. At the end of this [[Touhous]], they will be given a [[Congratulations Screen]] at the end of said minigame! What fun! The [[Music]] and [[Congratulations Screen]] [[Image]] vary from character to character. 

Below are some of the routes I've played through thus far. My memory is a bit fuzzy just because there's so much packed in each, so there might be some inaccuracies. I've played through all of the [[Damn seal|Damn seal members']] routes (and then some), so I hope that might give you a good preview of just what [[Classic Mode]] is all about.


''Classic mode opponents that are non-competitors, i.e. [[Boss|bosses]], will be indicated with an asterisk (*).''

==[[Paper Niko]]: [[Rock]], [[Paper]], [[Scissors]]!==
[[File:PaperNiko AllStarCongrats.png|thumb|right|300px|Paper Niko's congratulations screen.]]
True to the route's title, Paper Niko's Classic Mode opponents consist of stone, paper, and blade-related characters, with his evil counterpart Paper Okin appearing at the end of the route. Items, [[Assist Trophy]] summons, and [[Pok√©mon]] for each round will always correspond to the opponent's elemental weaknesses (ie. on rounds with paper-[[based]] opponents, Pok√© Balls will only release [[Scizor]] and [[Snivy]]). The route is both a nod to Paper Niko being made out of paper and a reference to [[Rock paper scissors matchup chart|''Rock paper scissors'']], an iconic [[A Fighting Game|Fighting Game]] within many esports circles.

[[Credits]] roll after completing Classic Mode. Completing it as Paper Niko has ''[[Flipper Flop]]'' accompany the credits.

==[[Dexter Cut]]: The Lost Media Huntdown== 
[[File:NormalCactus.png|thumb|right|[[File:Dexter cut catchphrase.png|200px]]<br>Dexter Cut's congratulations screen.|link=Cactus|200px]]
Dexter Cut's opponents consist of characters with a relation to missing or obfuscated information. All rounds are [[Stamina battle|stamina battles]] in which Dexter Cut starts with 150 HP.

Although playable, the route appears to be unfinished; in addition to being the only route that lacks a {{Blink|final opponent}}, many players have pointed out that the bonus round‚Äînotorious for its tendency to crash the wiki‚Äîis a placeholder carried over from the development of [[The Wiki Camp|The Wiki Camp 1]]. These issues have yet to be fixed as of [[Challenge 3: Edit War|Patch 3.0]].

[[File:AllBosses.png|right|thumb|350px|123 Referee's congratulations screen.]]
True to its wrestling-themed title, 123 Referee's route features opponents who are foils to each other. All rounds consist of stamina battles set on the [[Boxing Ring]] stage, with standard rounds being free-for-alls in which 123 Referee and her opponents start with 100 HP and 200 HP respectively. Unusually, her opponents will not attempt to attack her until after the other has been KO'd. 

As a nod to her real name, [[Banana Peels]] (and very rarely [[Banana Guns]]) are the only items besides [[Smash Ball|Smash Balls]] that spawn in 123 Referee's route.

Vandalism on The Wiki Camp 2's route follows Vandalism on The Wiki Camp 2 as they commit increasingly heinous acts of vandalism to various characters. This culminates in the final round, where these characters collectively return to fight them. With a whopping 11 opponents in the final round, Vandalism on The Wiki Camp 2's Classic Mode route is notorious for being among the hardest in the camp. 

This route has been a subject of [[urban legend]] on [[YouTube]] for quite some time. Many players claim that in some copies of The Wiki Camp 2, Vandalism on The Wiki Camp 2's tag becomes progressively warped and evil-looking the further they [[advance]] into the [[route]]. Whether this is a bug or an intentional feature, players posit that Vandalism on The Wiki Camp 2's actual appearance is unaffected by this phenomenon.

==[[Lost Artifact]]: Lost Artifact, Invader of Europe==
[[File:Elizabeth10.png|thumb|right|350px|Lost Artifact's congratulations screen.]]
Each round in Lost Artifact's route is themed after countries in [[Europe]]. Starting with [[Italy]], the route eventually makes its way to [[Britain]], where [[Queen Elizabeth II]] is fought as the final boss. Defeating Queen Elizabeth II is assumed to represent Lost Artifact taking the crown and later becoming the route's namesake. <small>But, at what cost? Was it really worth it?</small>

The songs that play during Rounds 2-5 are also related to dogs. As the title suggests, the route is an ironic nod to Bullseye being the roster's [[Token Dog Character]].
