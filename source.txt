[[File:Editexample.png|thumb|An example of what an edit war may look like.]]
An [[Edit War]] is when two users or groups of users on a wiki disruptively overwrite each other's edits, usually due to having conflicting views on how the article should be presented. A [[LiSt|list]] of notable edit wars can be found on [[Wikipedia]]‚Äôs [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars Lamest edit wars].

==History==
The Edit War began during [[Challenge 3: Edit War|Challenge 3]]. On November 11, 2022, [[The Divine Goddess]] told the contestants to violently kill this poor article{{Citation needed}}. It is unknown why She wanted the page to suffer such a gruesome fate.

Hello, this is [[Diary]].

Look through these gizmos and follow the instructions of the [[Toy Blocks|toy(s)]] you want to play with. Or, don‚Äôt do that and play with the toys in ways the toymakers haven‚Äôt intended‚Ä¶? I dunno, I just want to get rid of all this [[Paper Niko|useless junk]]. Have fun.

An [[Edit War]] is when two or more users on a wiki disruptively overwrite each other's edits, usually due to having conflicting views on how the article should be presented or through prevention of [[Vandalism on The Wiki Camp 2|vandalism]]. An Edit War can be started on one's own terms through second thoughts. A [[LiSt|list]] of notable edit wars can be found on [[Wikipedia]]'s [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars Lamest edit wars].

<span style="color:#ff0055;"> <nowiki>:</nowiki>O <( so like this doesn't count as an edit war right. cause each person only edits it once )

Another [[notable]] example of an Edit War was the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Great_Edit_War Great Edit War], which was [[centered]] around the [[national origin]] of the [[Caesar salad]] between [[2|two]] [[faction]]s.

Fake Edit Wars are known to exist, but we don't talk about those here.{{Citation needed|reason=Or do you..? Hey, VSauce, Michael here. Edit wars are known to be disruptive to the whole of Wikipedia and other wikis alike‚Ä¶ but what about FAKE edit wars?}}

<center>{{Dia|Beato4|And for my assistance to be requested here of all places feels like an unamusing joke.}}</center>

'''( WHO??? )> @@'''

'''[I'm gonna drop the colour thing here and replace it with bold text, it looks bad on the background.]'''

==History==
The Edit War began during [[Challenge 3: Edit War|Challenge 3]]. On November 11, 2022, [[The Divine Goddess]] told the contestants to violently kill this poor article.{{Citation needed}} It is unknown why She wanted the page to suffer such a gruesome fate, but many suspect that it is due to an ongoing conflict.

<center>{{Dia|Beato3|I have another witch in mind who would be much more suitable to "kill this article" than I, if only she wasn't much harder to get a hold of.}}</center>
<center>{{Dia|Beato6|My, I hope I was more than a compromise! Kuhihihi...}}</center>

The Edit War was a [[fun challenge]] where everyone [[Died Horribly|died horribly]] due to excessive [[edits]].

The Edit War was such a [[sweet summer child]], having been raised by [[Yuri|two mothers]]. Really though, The Edit War emerged from [[Homestuck|a direct asteroid collision with Earth]], and was then adopted by the awesome mothers. [[The Divine Goddess]] took note of this, not for any other reason but because it was so perfect for a challenge that She couldn't miss this one [[opportunity]]. (And thanks to the [[shareholders]].)

The Edit War was so so sad! Why would The Divine Goddess wish such [[cruelty]] among one page??? It was so. So. SO uncalled for. Just like [[Sealon Musk]]'s purchase of [[Twitter]]. [[Twitter's Doomsday Clock|You know how that's going on.]]

The Edit War TRIED to at least get some [[NOTICE TO CEASE AND DESIST|class action lawsuit]] going, but [[:Category:Still in (official)|everyone]] was too busy focusing on turning this kid into [[Damn Seal|something so UNBEARABLE]].

Today when I walked into my [[economics class]] I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new [[gaming laptop]] to class. The [[Forklift]] he used to bring it was still running [[idle]] at the back. I started [[sweating]] as I sat down and gazed over at the [[700lb beast]] that was his [[laptop]]. He had already reinforced his desk with [[steel support beams]] and was in the process of finding an [[outlet]] for a [[power cable]] thicker than [[Amy Schumer]]'s thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's [[nothing]] to worry about. He somehow finds [[a fucking outlet]]. [[Tears]] are running down my [[cheeks]] as I send my last [[text]]s to my family saying I love them. The [[teacher]] starts the [[lecture]], and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his [[RGB Backlit keyboard]] flare to life like a [[nuclear flash]], and a [[deep humming]] fills my ears and shakes my very [[soul]]. The entire city [[power grid]] goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from [[vibrant]] life, to a [[dark]], [[earth shattering]] [[void]] where my body is getting torn apart by the [[150mph gale force winds]] and the [[500 decibel groan]] of the [[cooling fans]]. As my body finally [[surrenders]], I weep, as my school and my city go [[Undertale|under]]. I fucking [[hate]] gaming laptops.

The above [[paragraph]] appeared to be inspiring to poor old Edit War, but it wasn't enough to combat the [[approaching beasts]].

!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

Do the [[konami code]] for something cool. Actually, there's no [[functionality]] for that on this page. [[Javascript]] is a [[Kaste|DOG]].

==Personality==
I live in the [[American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor]]. My name is [[Patrick Bateman]]. I'm 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a [[balanced diet]] and [[rigorous exercise routine]]. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I'll put on an ice pack while doing [[stomach crunches]]. I can do [[1000]] now. After I remove the ice pack I use a [[deep pore cleanser lotion]]. In the shower I use a [[water activated gel cleanser]], then a [[honey almond body scrub]], and on the face an [[exfoliating gel scrub]]. Then I apply an [[herb-mint facial mask]] which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my [[routine]]. I always use an after [[shave lotion]] with little or no [[alcohol]], because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look [[older]]. Then [[moisturizer]], then an [[anti-aging eye balm]] followed by a final [[moisturizing protective lotion]].

The Edit War is so EVIL. SO SWEET!!! So [[Undertale|stuck at home]]... Edit Worth is so [[Sans|bonetastic]], says the funny. Can't say that I have!<ref>Can't say that I reference!</ref>

==Ingredients==
[[Almondmilk]] ([[Filtered Water]], [[Almonds]]), [[Cane Sugar]], [[Vitamin and Mineral Blend]] ([[Calcium Carbonate]], [[Vitamin E Acetate]], [[Vitamin A Palmitate]], [[Vitamin D2]]), [[Sea Salt]], [[Gellan Gum]], [[Sunflower Lecithin]], [[Locust Bean Gum]], [[Ascorbic Acid]] (to protect freshness), [[Natural Flavor]].

At least [[1|one]] [[Big Mac]] from [[Wendy's]]. Maybe some [[diamond]]s, too. But these diamonds must need to be obtained from [[villager]]s. But ONLY the ones that come from [[Minecraft mod]]s. Specifically ones from [[CurseForge]]. Oh yeah, and one [[bucket of sand]]. [[Seal]]s could also work.

Make sure to crush this all into a [[thin paste]] after you're done mixing it all up.

review: i ate aALL of this recipe after i made it PERFECTLY and i almost died. 2/5 stars (one star for killing seals)

==Geography==
The province lies in the mountainous area with the average elevation of 550 meters which contains several thousands of [[cave]]s. These caves are intraversable.

==Coverage==
Edit War has competed to be the longest page on [[The Wiki Camp 2]] and [[The Infamous Wiki]], the latter being fairly new. So far, Edit War has competed in -1 challenges and has acquired an undisclosed amount of points.

==Death==
The Edit War has not yet suffered any fatal [[accident]]s, but it sure is suffering ''accidents''. At the end of [[Challenge 3: Edit War|Challenge 3]], expect no life from what was once a [[flourishing]] page.

'''( hey weird lady, is this paragraph talking about what you were going to do? or is it just misinformation )> ^^?'''

{{Dia|Beato6|Who's to say, in the end?}}

'''/:/ <( you? )'''

[[Back Into The Future|Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under. I fucking hate gaming laptops.]]

==References in other media==
In [[Wikipedia]], Edit Wars are super common. The lead for this page has a link to its [[lame]]st ones yet.

In [[Some Other Media]], Edit Wars are the main [[antagonist]] against the main [[protagonist]]'s home planet. The plot involves [[Nuke|highly destructive weapons]] that can wipe out entire [[infrastructure]] in mere minutes, proving to be an effective tool against even the toughest of Edit Wars.

In [[Homestuck]], Edit Wars aren't mentioned at all, but could be an occurring thing in [[WikiFAQs]].

In [[Battle for Dream Island]], [[Edit Warry]] is the 40th contestant.

'''<nowiki>:</nowiki>U <( edit wars are a lot more common than i thought. weird that i've never been a part of one! )'''

'''[But you have?]'''

'''( really?? when? )> :O'''

'''[Everything with you, me, and Playlist, on the fanclub team? That was an edit war.]'''

'''( my first edit war... )> ^^'''
{{Dia|Beato3|Hmm? Who is this? A fourth party involved in talking across the page?}}
{{Dia|Beato8|Kuhihi, how curious... you seem to exist as one of many forms! This case truly is shaping up to be something.}}

==Judging Criteria==
Whoever is named [[Nerpy Scuba]] is able to select those who are safe in this challenge up to 85 competitors.

10 shares are offered to [[The Irreverent Nonbeliever]].

'''BD <( emoticon and her team get first place!!!!!!! )'''

==Results==
TBD

==Guide==
First off, you'll want to head up north to the [[Devious Hills]]. That's where you'll get the best available loot for your journey. You'll mostly want [[Damn Coins]] and [[Heckled Gems]], but make sure to equip the best tools and armory. Next, you'll want to make your way to the [[Edit Caverns]], which can be recognized by its jagged [[Code Rocks]]. When you get there, grind for as long as you can, but make sure to aim for the weakest monsters first. After you're satisfied with your level and statistics, you can face off the [[Edit War Boss]]. It'll take at least a couple of minutes to progress between phases, but eventually you'll defeat them and win the game.

==Yard sale==
Hello, this is [[Diary]]. Throughout this competition I've been collecting a lot of these [[The Toy Where You Put The Shape In The Corresponding Hole|weird toys]], and figured I've gathered enough to start my own [[yard sale]]. Look through these gizmos and follow the instructions of the [[Toy Blocks|toy(s)]] you want to play with. Or, don't do that and play with the toys in ways the toymakers haven't intended‚Ä¶? I dunno, I just want to get rid of all this [[Paper Niko|useless junk]]. Have fun.

Hello, this is [[Jurta]]. Thank you.
