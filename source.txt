|review=it goes without saying that daft punk is one of the greatest artists in the history of electronic dance music. bangalter and guy-manuel both pioneered the french house genre starting with their debut album "Homework" and would eventually go on to create Discovery, which took their style in a whole new futuristic direction. this album is a personal favorite of mine and includes several of my favorite tracks from the duo, ranging from the awesome guitar solo in "Aerodynamic" to the almost future funk-esque sound of "High Life".

every track on here is great and notable in its own way and i love it. i highly recommend this album to pretty much anyone looking to get into edm.

|review=breakbeat that is just THE COOLEST!!!!!!!!!!! this is probably like, my second favourite album ever!?? the way it utilizes its samples and builds onto them like woah..........i personally don't look into luke vibert's other stuff much, (i liked yosepH, but not much else) but this is one h*ll of a side-project!!! i love the way it develops as well :0 with its (imo) best tracks right at the beginning and end x) nighty night is such a cheery song despite being the last one and it fills me with this warmth and this idea that maybe one day people will feel that way about MY music too. it's very nice x) go listen to it!

|review=throughout my time competing on the wiki camp i've read about plenty of strange characters. one competitor that stood out to me was the [[U.U.F.O|uufo]]. despite this object being a part of [[Host|my team]], i still have no idea what this thing actually is. [[LiSt|stereo]], another teammate of mine, found this record inside of its interior. an album with a cover depicting the titular vehicle in space. i decided to give it a listen.

what i was met with was a festival of very well made EDM tunes. i feel like i was taken on an intergalactic journey as i went from track to track. while i didn't know much about the u.u.f.o. before now, i feel like hearing this record made me understand its nature more. very interesting.

|review=samples are neat. they're an essential part of a lot of house subgenres. it's very fun to hear bits and pieces of other songs transformed into something new. uppermost's Polis takes that concept and goes all in, with an album consisting exclusively of samples.

right of the bat, the album opens with "Evi", a hard electro track which uses the likeness of california gurls by [[Katy Perry|katy perry]]. "Dixit" and "Aven" are personal favorites of mine, being awesome megamixes of [[Daft Punk]] and [[Linkin Park]] respectively. there's also "Bios", a track which takes ross ross ross by [[sebastiAn]] and turns it into something that almost sounds like a cinematic score.

and much more. i could go on about the tracks in this album, but those are my favorites. uppermost's early work is something i really enjoy listening too for it's unique sampling style. i highly recommend this album, as well as "[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLooK3mNEQaI-zHIgs7j8f76LUdjgn5H3D Control]".

|review=There's a certain harmony unique to Mockasin's psychedelia. It's lush (wordplay unintended), yet strikingly dissonant. It's no wonder that his second album, Caramel, is one of a confusing and almost worrying wonder, especially in tracks like 'Why Are You Crying?' whose place of concern I probably don't need to explain. However, it still manages to take a mellow and playful approach to its subtones, and Mockasin's vocals on the album decisively add to its surrealness. Also he sounds like me harererhhaarsherheaa lmao. i showed this album to my husband and he cried 200 times

|review=when it comes to french electro, one of the most popular artists in the genre is Justice. and that's for good reason, their album Cross released in 2007 made its mark as one of the most influental albums in electronica.

the tracks on this record flow perfectly into eachother, and not a single song is wasted on here. with classics like "genesis", "D.A.N.C.E.", "DVNO", "waters of nazareth", and i'll even go as far to say as "tthhee ppaarrttyy" is criminally overhated, i believe this album still holds up today as a timeless classic.

'''EDIT:''' wait i think i published the review on the wrong album. how do i delete reviews??
