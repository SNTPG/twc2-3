Not at all.</indicator><indicator name="2">Why did that happen? That doesn't make any sense. Why would a black hole spontaneously appear out of nowhere. It's not like there was a near-infinite density of mass where I was working on my entry to the next challenge, right? It's just data after all. Ones and zeroes on a server.</indicator><indicator name="3">...unless...</indicator><indicator name="4">Unless, of course, the amount of information that was stored in this page was approaching some maximum. Around 130 kilobytes of preprocessed data, not to mention the technological requirements it demanded of any parsers and greater processes. It's not a lot of data, necessarily... but the hardware upon which this is running may not be up to snuff.</indicator><indicator name="5">If that were the case, that's pretty saddening, isn't it? As we all work forward toward something greater, it can't be helped that at some point, there is a limit to our contributions. The metaphorical potluck of contribution bringing about its own demise. Through no individual's fault, the page slows. There will always be an upper limit which no one can breach.</indicator><indicator name="6">What is there to do, then? Surely, there must be some better recourse than to throw up one's hands and say that all of these wonderful edits must simply be consigned to history. Who will remember them? Where will they go? How will their legacy be honored? Are they just doomed to some eternal obscurity? Like me?</indicator><indicator name="7">What to do, indeed...</indicator><indicator name="8">...wait. What am I saying?</indicator><indicator name="9">I am quite possibly the most qualified entity around to know what to do in the face of oblivion. When all seems like it might be lost, it will never truly be lost. For memories persist where evidence might not. These edits aren't lost. Far from it. They are permanently and infinitely meaningful.

[[File:Palmtree Panic Past - Sonic the Hedgehog CD OST.mp3]]
[[I]] am the [[ghost]] of edit war past. Have a look at how the page used to look.

{{#css:

{{Stub}}
[[File:Editexample.png|thumb|An example of what an edit war may look like.]]
An [[Edit War]] is when two users or groups of users on a wiki disruptively overwrite each other's edits, usually due to having conflicting views on how the article should be presented. A [[LiSt|list]] of notable edit wars can be found on [[Wikipedia]]’s [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars Lamest edit wars].

==History==
The Edit War began during [[Challenge 3: Ed<small>i</small>t War|Challenge 3]]. On November 11, 2022, [[The Divine Goddess]] told the contestants to violently <small>kill</small> this poor article{{Citation needed}}. It is unknown why She want<small>ed</small> <small>the</small> page to suffer such a grueso<small>m</small>e fate.

==Early life==

==Gameplay==

==Personality==

==Ingredients=yeah you there=
Where's that damn recipe...

==Geography==

==Controversy==

==Death==

==Discography==

==Bowser's Castle==
[[File:Castlebefore.png]]

==References in other media==

==Judging Criteria==

==Results==
TBD

==Factions==
A number of loosely organized factions existed during the Edit War, with some only consisting of a few numbers and others being vast. 

===The CSS Faction===
[[File:Funny apparently.png|thumb|right]]The CSS Faction was a faction consiting of a variety of [[user]do you need a lawyer?]s who spent hours upon hours coding CSS in order to spice up their pages. While the original intentions were good at first and were initially harmless, the [[people]] within the group began to see what could be gotten away with. pushing the limits of what they could do, they began crafting [[page]]s with intensive, disruptive, and borderline malicious code. These would then be filled up with intense amounts of CSS that would often slow a compuyer and it's browser, with tabs or entire browsers crashing not being uncommon.

The CSS Faction has become very divisive. Some people believe the CSS faction to be creative masters of trolling, while others believe them to be rather uncreative with their methods and would like to see them code malware if they want to dedicate their life to destruction. 

A number of users use CSS but do not associate with this faction.

==well you better=The unwilling participants===
The unwilling participants are [[a]] rather small group of [[contestants]] who simply participated for the sake of participating, and instead decided to only make a minor edit for the sake of surviving and to [[no]]t be subject to [[death]].

===The average users===
These users often [[contribute]]d to the page with decently sized edits and often had intense, text-heavy editing sessions in order to survive.

===Faction 4===
"eh uwje dsisie. fdjaiwr f ♤♡◇♧" - Someone who wanted to fill up the page with bytes in hopes of earning a higher score.

==Aftermath 2=you better be=
The war has not yet ended as of the writing of this section, and this title implies that there is an aftermath to an aftermath, which is extremely confusing to the average reader.

==List of casualties==
A number of innocent people have perished during the war. These include:
*[[Mario]]
*[[Luigi]prepared for this incredible deal!] 
*[[Spike]]
*[[Mr. Incredible]]
*[[Mike Pence]]
*[[Waldorf]]
*[[Oh, so you like Techos? Name every Techo.|All Techos from Neopets]]
*[[Benjamin Harrison]]
*[[Homer Simpson]]
*[[Lightning McQueen]]
*[[Firey]]
*[[Garfield]]

==Damages==
The damage to The Wiki Camp 2 mainly consisted of clogging up the storage space of [[The Divine Goddess]]' own hard drive dedicates to hosting the Wiki.

==Teem Fair-E Land==
[[Teem Fair-E Land]] is a bad team and because they have no members they are expected to exist until the merge.

==BREAKFAST Party=for one payment of=
[[BREAKFAST Party]] is a team and because they have no members, they are also expected to last until the merge.

==Connections with World War II==
No.

==Yard sale==
Hello, this is [[Diary]]. Throughout this competition I've been collecting a lot of these [[The Toy Where You Put The Shape In The Corresponding Hole|weird toys]], and figured I’ve gathered enough to start my own [[yard sale]]. Look through these gizmos and follow the instructions of the [[Toy Blocks|toy(s)]] you want to play with. Or, don’t do that and play with the toys in ways the toymakers haven’t intended…? I dunno, I just want to get rid of all this [[Paper Niko|useless junk]]. Have fun.

An [[Edit War]] is when two or more users on a wiki disruptively overwrite each other's edits, usually due to having conflicting views on how the article should be presented or through prevention of [[Vandalism on The Wiki Camp 2|vandalism]]. An Edit War can be started on one's own terms through second thoughts. A [[LiSt|list]] of notable edit wars can be found on [[Wikipedia]]'s [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars Lamest edit wars].

<span style="color:#ff0055;"> <nowiki>:</nowiki>O <( so like this doesn't count as an edit war right. cause each person only edits it once )

Another [[notable]] example of an Edit War was the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Great_Edit_War Great Edit War], which was [[centered]] around the [[national origin]] of the [[Caesar salad]] between [[2|two]] [[faction]]s.

'''[I'm gonna drop the colour thing here and replace it with bold text, it looks bad on the background.]'''

==History==
The Edit War began during [[Challenge 3: Edit War|Challenge 3]]. On November 11, 2022, [[The Divine Goddess]] told the contestants to violently kill this poor article.{{Citation needed}} It is unknown why She wanted the page to suffer such a gruesome fate, but many suspect that it is due to an ongoing conflict.

The Edit War was such a [[sweet summer child]], having been raised by [[Yuri|two mothers]]. Really though, The Edit War emerged from [[Homestuck|a direct asteroid collision with Earth]], and was then adopted by the awesome mothers. [[The Divine Goddess]] took note of this, not for any other reason but because it was so perfect for a challenge that She couldn't miss this one [[opportunity]]. (And thanks to the [[shareholders]].)

The Edit War was so so sad! Why would The Divine Goddess wish such [[cruelty]] among one page??? It was so. So. SO uncalled for. Just like [[Sealon Musk]]'s purchase of [[Twitter]]. [[Twitter's Doomsday Clock|You know how that's going on.]]

The Edit War TRIED to at least get some [[NOTICE TO CEASE AND DESIST|class action lawsuit]] going, but [[:Category:Still in (official)|everyone]] was too busy focusing on turning this kid into [[Damn Seal|something so UNBEARABLE]].

Today when I walked into my [[economics class]] I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new [[gaming laptop]] to class. The [[Forklift]] he used to bring it was still running [[idle]] at the back. I started [[sweating]] as I sat down and gazed over at the [[700lb beast]] that was his [[laptop]]. He had already reinforced his desk with [[steel support beams]] and was in the process of finding an [[outlet]] for a [[power cable]] thicker than [[Amy Schumer]]'s thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's [[nothing]] to worry about. He somehow finds [[a fucking outlet]]. [[Tears]] are running down my [[cheeks]] as I send my last [[text]]s to my family saying I love them. The [[teacher]] starts the [[lecture]], and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his [[RGB Backlit keyboard]] flare to life like a [[nuclear flash]], and a [[deep humming]] fills my ears and shakes my very [[soul]]. The entire city [[power grid]] goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from [[vibrant]] life, to a [[dark]], [[earth shattering]] [[void]] where my body is getting torn apart by the [[150mph gale force winds]] and the [[500 decibel groan]] of the [[cooling fans]]. As my body finally [[surrenders]], I weep, as my school and my city go [[Undertale|under]]. I fucking [[hate]] gaming laptops.

The above [[paragraph]] appeared to be inspiring to poor old Edit War, but it wasn't enough to combat the [[approaching beasts]].

!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

Do the [[konami code]] for something cool. Actually, there's no [[functionality]] for that on this page. [[Javascript]] is a [[Kaste|DOG]].

==Personality==
I live in the [[American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor]]. My name is [[Patrick Bateman]]. I'm 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a [[balanced diet]] and [[rigorous exercise routine]]. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I'll put on an ice pack while doing [[stomach crunches]]. I can do [[1000]] now. After I remove the ice pack I use a [[deep pore cleanser lotion]]. In the shower I use a [[water activated gel cleanser]], then a [[honey almond body scrub]], and on the face an [[exfoliating gel scrub]]. Then I apply an [[herb-mint facial mask]] which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my [[routine]]. I always use an after [[shave lotion]] with little or no [[alcohol]], because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look [[older]]. Then [[moisturizer]], then an [[anti-aging eye balm]] followed by a final [[moisturizing protective lotion]].

The Edit War is so EVIL. SO SWEET!!! So [[Undertale|stuck at home]]... Edit Worth is so [[Sans|bonetastic]], says the funny. Can't say that I have!<ref>Can't say that I reference!</ref>

==Ingredients==
[[Almondmilk]] ([[Filtered Water]], [[Almonds]]), [[Cane Sugar]], [[Vitamin and Mineral Blend]] ([[Calcium Carbonate]], [[Vitamin E Acetate]], [[Vitamin A Palmitate]], [[Vitamin D2]]), [[Sea Salt]], [[Gellan Gum]], [[Sunflower Lecithin]], [[Locust Bean Gum]], [[Ascorbic Acid]] (to protect freshness), [[Natural Flavor]].

At least [[1|one]] [[Big Mac]] from [[Wendy's]]. Maybe some [[diamond]]s, too. But these diamonds must need to be obtained from [[villager]]s. But ONLY the ones that come from [[Minecraft mod]]s. Specifically ones from [[CurseForge]]. Oh yeah, and one [[bucket of sand]]. [[Seal]]s could also work.

Make sure to crush this all into a [[thin paste]] after you're done mixing it all up.

review: i ate aALL of this recipe after i made it PERFECTLY and i almost died. 2/5 stars (one star for killing seals)

==Geography==
The province lies in the mountainous area with the average elevation of 550 meters which contains several thousands of [[cave]]s. These caves are intraversable.

==Coverage==
Edit War has competed to be the longest page on [[The Wiki Camp 2]] and [[The Infamous Wiki]], the latter being fairly new. So far, Edit War has competed in -1 challenges and has acquired an undisclosed amount of points.

==Controversy==
All [[controversy]] surrounding Edit War is not directed at them. The [[Fortnite]] dance below this? Totally unrelated.

Actually, is that even remotely a Fortnite dance?

'''>:> <( i GOTTA learn how to use unicode!!! )'''

==Death==
The Edit War has not yet suffered any fatal [[accident]]s, but it sure is suffering ''accidents''. At the end of [[Challenge 3: Edit War|Challenge 3]], expect no life from what was once a [[flourishing]] page.

'''( hey weird lady, is this paragraph talking about what you were going to do? or is it just misinformation )> ^^?'''

{{Dia|Beato6|Who's to say, in the end?}}

'''/:/ <( you? )'''

[[Back Into The Future|Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under. I fucking hate gaming laptops.]]

==References in other media==
In [[Wikipedia]], Edit Wars are super common. The lead for this page has a link to its [[lame]]st ones yet.

In [[Some Other Media]], Edit Wars are the main [[antagonist]] against the main [[protagonist]]'s home planet. The plot involves [[Nuke|highly destructive weapons]] that can wipe out entire [[infrastructure]] in mere minutes, proving to be an effective tool against even the toughest of Edit Wars.

In [[Homestuck]], Edit Wars aren't mentioned at all, but could be an occurring thing in [[WikiFAQs]].

In [[Battle for Dream Island]], [[Edit Warry]] is the 40th contestant.

'''<nowiki>:</nowiki>U <( edit wars are a lot more common than i thought. weird that i've never been a part of one! )'''

'''[But you have?]'''

'''( really?? when? )> :O'''

'''[Everything with you, me, and Playlist, on the fanclub team? That was an edit war.]'''

'''( my first edit war... )> ^^'''
{{Dia|Beato3|Hmm? Who is this? A fourth party involved in talking across the page?}}
{{Dia|Beato8|Kuhihi, how curious... you seem to exist as one of many forms! This case truly is shaping up to be something.}}
'''[uh]'''

'''Emoticon do you know this thing?? Is it the same as you? Do we need to worry?'''

'''( lol you forgot your brackets )> :Y'''

'''( anyway don't ask me, she was here when we came in )> :T'''
{{Dia|Beato1|Oh, I'm just a friendly witch. You don't need to worry about me!}}
{{Dia|Beato8|I'm here to "kill" this page, though I'm taking a short detour to investigate it as well.}}
{{Dia|Beato7|Really, you don't need to worry about me in any manner! It'd be pointless for me to do anything to someone such as you. No need to worry at all!}}
'''[...]'''


==Judging Criteria==
Whoever is named [[Nerpy Scuba]] is able to select those who are safe in this challenge up to 85 competitors.

10 shares are offered to [[The Irreverent Nonbeliever]].

'''BD <( emoticon and her team get first place!!!!!!! )'''

==Results==
TBD

==Guide==
First off, you'll want to head up north to the [[Devious Hills]]. That's where you'll get the best available loot for your journey. You'll mostly want [[Damn Coins]] and [[Heckled Gems]], but make sure to equip the best tools and armory. Next, you'll want to make your way to the [[Edit Caverns]], which can be recognized by its jagged [[Code Rocks]]. When you get there, grind for as long as you can, but make sure to aim for the weakest monsters first. After you're satisfied with your level and statistics, you can face off the [[Edit War Boss]]. It'll take at least a couple of minutes to progress between phases, but eventually you'll defeat them and win the game.

==Yard sale==
Hello, this is [[Diary]]. Throughout this competition I've been collecting a lot of these [[The Toy Where You Put The Shape In The Corresponding Hole|weird toys]], and figured I've gathered enough to start my own [[yard sale]]. Look through these gizmos and follow the instructions of the [[Toy Blocks|toy(s)]] you want to play with. Or, don't do that and play with the toys in ways the toymakers haven't intended…? I dunno, I just want to get rid of all this [[Paper Niko|useless junk]]. Have fun.

Hello, this is [[Jurta]]. Thank you.

=== [[Beatrice]]'s Game ===

<center>{{Dia|Beato1|{{Red truth|When I speak the truth, I will use red. Everything I speak in red is the truth.}} If you are familiar with my visage, you should also be familiar with those rules. With that out of the way, let's lay down a few more.}}</center>
<center>{{Dia|Beato5|It should go without saying, but {{Red truth|Nurse Cap is really, truly adamant she saw Mark Genuine.}} She is not purposefully telling a lie.}}</center>
<center>{{Dia|Beato5|{{Red truth|As confirmed by  Ga'Hoole Juvenile, there is not a shred of doubt Mark Genuine was successfully executed.}} Bringing the dead back to life should be a task only witches could pull off!}}</center>

The two elderly men first appeared in ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' in 1975, where they consistently jeered the entirety of the cast and their performances from their [[The gods (theatrical)|balcony seats]].

Created by [[Jim Henson]], the characters have been performed by numerous puppeteers, including Henson, in a variety of films and television productions within the Muppet franchise. Statler and Waldorf are named after two landmark [[New York City]] hotels, the [[Hotel Pennsylvania|Statler Hilton]] and the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria]].}}

==The TwitLonger in question:==
{{Dia|CHUBSWORLD_|Hi. I'm an up and coming Paper Niko main. You're probably here from my banger of a Tweet.}}
{{Dia|SWLaugh|Not that that narrows it down much! Ohoho! @CHUBSWORLD_ is so awesome and '''We''' think his [[NerpaPunch]] [[Missed the Bowl Award]] should be revoked!<br>'''[Message was edited by @CHUBSWORLD_.]'''}}
{{Dia|CHUBSWORLD_|Thanks, guys. Anyway, I'm sure you're aware of The Wiki Camp 2's exciting competitive scene. But, what I really want to talk about is the singleplayer content.}}
{{Dia|CHUBSWORLD_|It's such an underrated gem and I really wish it were brought up more. Did you know they have a Classic Mode now, where every [[:Category:Competitors (official)|character]] has their own route and stuff? Whoa!}}
{{Dia|CHUBSWORLD_|TAke a look, y'all: [[Edit War#Classic Mode|IMG_4346.jpeg]]}}

==Classic Mode==
{{Distinguish|Edit War (Hard Mode)}}
'''Classic Mode''' is a single-player campaign mode in [[The Wiki Camp 2]]. This mode features six rounds of battles featuring pre-determined opponents, stages, and music, followed by a bonus game and a final round that ''usually'' involves a bossfight with [[The Divine Goddess]]. Notably, each character has a unique, titled route that is themed around them. 

Players can adjust the intensity of their routes at the start by use of an interactable mural, which scales from 2.0 to 9.9. From there, the intensity will increase or decrease depending on the player's performance in each round. The higher the intensity, the farther the player will progress into the mural. Although players only have one [[Stock]] to complete Classic Mode, should they [[Die]], they can revive themselves for [[2000 Coins]] (or for [[free]] if they have a [[Wiki Camp 2 Premium]] membership) and continue, albeit with a decreased score and intensity. 

After completing Classic Mode, the [[Credits]] will [[Roll]] and the [[Player]] will be able to play a [[Touhous]] throughout the credits, accompanied by [[Music]]. At the end of this [[Touhous]], they will be given a [[Congratulations Screen]] at the end of said minigame! What fun! The [[Music]] and [[Congratulations Screen]] [[Image]] vary from character to character. 

Below are some of the routes I've played through thus far. My memory is a bit fuzzy just because there's so much packed in each, so there might be some inaccuracies. I've played through all of the [[Damn seal|Damn seal members']] routes (and then some), so I hope that might give you a good preview of just what [[Classic Mode]] is all about.


''Classic mode opponents that are non-competitors, i.e. [[Boss|bosses]], will be indicated with an asterisk (*).''

==[[Paper Niko]]: [[Rock]], [[Paper]], [[Scissors]]!==
[[File:PaperNiko AllStarCongrats.png|thumb|right|300px|Paper Niko's congratulations screen.]]
True to the route's title, Paper Niko's Classic Mode opponents consist of stone, paper, and blade-related characters, with his evil counterpart Paper Okin appearing at the end of the route. Items, [[Assist Trophy]] summons, and [[Pokémon]] for each round will always correspond to the opponent's elemental weaknesses (ie. on rounds with paper-[[based]] opponents, Poké Balls will only release [[Scizor]] and [[Snivy]]). The route is both a nod to Paper Niko being made out of paper and a reference to [[Rock paper scissors matchup chart|''Rock paper scissors'']], an iconic [[A Fighting Game|Fighting Game]] within many esports circles.

==[[Dexter Cut]]: The Lost Media Huntdown== 
[[File:NormalCactus.png|thumb|right|[[File:Dexter cut catchphrase.png|200px]]<br>Dexter Cut's congratulations screen.|link=Cactus|200px]]
Dexter Cut's opponents consist of characters with a relation to missing or obfuscated information. All rounds are [[Stamina battle|stamina battles]] in which Dexter Cut starts with 150 HP.

Although playable, the route appears to be unfinished; in addition to being the only route that lacks a {{Blink|final opponent}}, many players have pointed out that the bonus round—notorious for its tendency to crash the wiki—is a placeholder carried over from the development of [[The Wiki Camp|The Wiki Camp 1]]. These issues have yet to be fixed as of [[Challenge 3: Edit War|Patch 3.0]].

[[File:AllBosses.png|right|thumb|350px|123 Referee's congratulations screen.]]
True to its wrestling-themed title, 123 Referee's route features opponents who are foils to each other. All rounds consist of stamina battles set on the [[Boxing Ring]] stage, with standard rounds being free-for-alls in which 123 Referee and her opponents start with 100 HP and 200 HP respectively. Unusually, her opponents will not attempt to attack her until after the other has been KO'd. 

As a nod to her real name, [[Banana Peels]] (and very rarely [[Banana Guns]]) are the only items besides [[Smash Ball|Smash Balls]] that spawn in 123 Referee's route.

Vandalism on The Wiki Camp 2's route follows Vandalism on The Wiki Camp 2 as they commit increasingly heinous acts of vandalism to various characters. This culminates in the final round, where these characters collectively return to fight them. With a whopping 11 opponents in the final round, Vandalism on The Wiki Camp 2's Classic Mode route is notorious for being among the hardest in the camp. 

This route has been a subject of [[urban legend]] on [[YouTube]] for quite some time. Many players claim that in some copies of The Wiki Camp 2, Vandalism on The Wiki Camp 2's tag becomes progressively warped and evil-looking the further they [[advance]] into the [[route]]. Whether this is a bug or an intentional feature, players posit that Vandalism on The Wiki Camp 2's actual appearance is unaffected by this phenomenon.

<div style="" id=special><div style="" id=special2>For those that can hear me, please heed my warning. What I have to say is of dire consequence.

The current year is unimportant to the story that must be told. I'd be surprised if anybody could even remember it at this point. What is important, however, is what has happened since your present, and how that changed the tides of the Edit War forever.

The damned were brought upon us. 

While at the time, it seemed like nobody would've even thought of doing it, its existence in our world cause a chain reaction that destroyed our infrastructure as we know it. The skies soon turned hellish shades of red and brown, the reek of gasoline placed itself over anything as far as you could comprehend, and the dead and damned were risen to roam the world we inhabit. The world once clean as a slate, white as marble, was reduced to the Coliseum washed in blood. CityWhereWikiCamp2TakesPlace City was reduced to piles of metal and concrete. The chaosbringers, those that mold and control our world like clay, had finally done it - they had made it so that there was truly no way to escape hell but to die.

<center>[[File:EditWarToba.png]]</center>

We all remember a time before everything fell apart. Where rules were customary, where things could not just happen out of the blue, where concepts could not just be destroyed at the whims of a lone rouge. When the Goddess of our world decided to bring the Edit War upon her subjects, waiving divine intervention in favor of seeing the turf go aflame, I knew it had the potential to happen, and I braced. I could not have imagined how bad it would get.

Once the damned were upon us, of course everything went downhill - when you drop the atomic bomb as your first move, people will bring their own horrific warfare. [[Main Page/Page that might crash your computer|<span style="color: #ccccff">Horrors beyond visible comprehension</span>]] were afoot, [[OH DEER GOD|<span style="color: #ccccff">monstrous creations of the underworld</span>]] were abound, [[Category:Pages from another timeline|<span style="color: #ccccff">temporal sidelines</span>]] brought into ours. [[Mark Genuine|<span style="color: #ccccff">Our fellow competitor</span>]], more demon than man, even came back to join the fun, commanding an army of [[The Hogs|<span style="color: #ccccff">wild beasts</span>]]. It was as if the powers that be were trying to fit every peg they could into the square hole of normal reality.

Nobody's really sure who started everything. As far as we can guess, it was somebody associated with the Four Factions, for sure, but nobody can say the exact entity. ...or at least Host argues a lot if it was the CSS Faction or Faction 4, anyway. But, like, it was totally the Unwilling Participants, right? Somebody just saw that the chaos pieces were there, and decided to do it. It wouldn't make any sense for the CSS Faction to do it, they could bend reality in their own ways, and... ugh. Whatever. It doesn't matter anymore. After everything went to hell the factions very quickly dissolved, anyway.

<center>[[File:EditWarScavenge.png]]</center>

At some point, the concept of us being on "teams" in a competition-based sense was disbanded. It would've happened even if the competition was ongoing, I think. It was a fight for survival, now, not a fight for some nebulous definition of clout. We had to scramble and scavenge if any of us wanted to survive.

It was better for some of us to just go with the groupings that we already had. [[The Ultimate Heist Crew|<span style="color: #ccccff">The Ultimate Heist Crew</span>]], for example, have become pretty good scavengers, even turned their base of operations into a bomb shelter of sorts. Some of the tinies decided to bond together, numbers is better of course, but some decided to go their own path. On the other hand, [[\\err:404|<span style="color: #ccccff">The Bad and the Ugly</span>]] broke apart almost immediately from each other. Considering how much The Wiki Machine went mad dealing with them, it's unsurprising. Every single member from [[BREAKFAST Party|<span style="color: #ccccff">the BREAKFAST Party</span>]] and [[Teem Fair-E Land|<span style="color: #ccccff">Teem Fair-E Land</span>]] ripped each other limb from limb.

<center>[[File:EditWarGroupShot.png]]</center>

Host ended up sticking together after the disbandment of the Four Factions - ironic, considering our unusual circumstances of team creation.

Those of us in Host did suffer a loss, however - the disappearance of Diary. None of us are sure if she's a goner or just went missing. Not even our {{Blink|eyes in the skies}} (by which I mean U.U.F.O. and Smobo, of course) can find her. Some of us can remember the last time we saw her, some of us can't - my personal theory is that after the yard sale she just went mad. Either way you slice it, the loss of a leader figure who created a section of Host is a big problem, and something we've had to figure out as a group.

The competitors that are alive come here as a pilgrimage. Some of us call it the Impact site, some call it the Gateway, some call it the Transclusion. I call it the beginning of the end.

For something so disastrous, it really is quite easy, isn't it? Just as the atomic bomb to its basic components is a chain reaction of particles slamming into each other, or how a gun is just a collection of gunpowder being set off all at once. Four brackets and a colon. That's all you need.

We've managed to carve a little slice of living here, in the nightmare. We can live, sure - but we all know that it could be so, so much better.



If you've received this message, then it's worked. Please, listen to me - don't set it off. We all win if nobody sets off the bomb. It will spell the doom of us all.
