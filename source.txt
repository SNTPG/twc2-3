Alright, Team 17ers! It's time for an edit...

...war?

Huh!

This place seems to be as barren as my grasp on the Homestuck series!

...

I guess it could only mean one thing...

...

...

Some peace and quiet!

Gosh, this place has been ballistic for so long that I cannot even keep track of anything!

I guess while I am at it, I can probably muster up some ideas for...

...*yawn*! But then again... with this kind of atmosphere, I could probably use some shut-eye...

...warfare can come later...

...what could possibly go wrong?

...

[[File:ShockwaveExplain.jpg|frameless|left]]
Hey guys, shockwave here to explain the joke. Much like [[China Bond Funds Restrict Inflows As Investors Pile In To Take Shelter]], the page Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars for the Xbox 360 is used once more because Damn Seal would be much too destructive to transclude, and even then, it wouldn't be that funny to many who have yet to edit the page. <br>
Shockwave out!

* For many [[centuries]] and [[eons]] an [[apple]] has been known to [[humans]],.This is known as a fact by many. But when it comes to the kinds, shapes, and varities of an apple, some humans find that thwy don't know it all? Below I have included an image and transcription of the apples humans know and love.

== FIRST APPLE ==

=== 1920 x 1080 Apple ===
this apple was first known to me only [[seconds]] ago. rival to the average [[red]] apple, it boasts capabilities unlike any mankind has ever seen before. With notable flavors and colors, the 1920 x 1080 apple is known for its appeal. It has earned the name "apple of apples?

== GREEN APPLE ==

The apple goes from being completely green to turning yellow when overripeThe apple goes from being completely green to turning yellow when overripeThe apple goes from being completely green to turning yellow when overripeThe apple goes from being completely green to turning yellow when overripeThe apple goes from being completely green to turning yellow when overripeThe apple goes from being completely green to turning yellow when overripeThe apple goes from being completely green to turning yellow when overripeThe apple goes from being completely green to turning yellow when overripeThe apple goes from being completely green to turning yellow when overripeThe apple goes from being completely green to turning yellow when overripe

== The New Apple ==
So b asically in my haste I had to invent a new kind of apple to finish the last. ummmmmmmmmm im kind of shy to show it to you so give me a second here, i only had 2 seconds to make it. its kind of ''soft'', kind of evil, and '''kind''' of DELICIOUS<blockquote>introducing</blockquote>
